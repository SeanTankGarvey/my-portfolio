      Sean Garvey was born on September 6, 1989.  He is currently 27 years old.  Sean is working towards becomming a professional web developer, by building a variety of webpages such as this one that you are reading. He also codes small programs in JavaScript (somewhat rarely), Python (most frequently), and now in Ruby (becomming more frequent by the week).  You can check out some samples at <a href="https://repl.it/@seangarvey" target="_blank">repl.it/@seangarvey</a>.

      Sean spends his virtually all his free time learning HTML5 (and about HTML organization principles), as well as studying CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) including CSS3, both pragmatic useage and foundational design theory - things like flexbox and responsive design, in particular.

      Sean had been focusing on learning Python, but now he is beginning to learn Ruby.  Additionally, Sean is finishing up a 10-week paid course through Codecademy called Code Intensive Pro (formerly CodeREADY) that basically teaches freelance website development, layout/positioning, and design, including how to make responsive sites for tablets and cell phones.  Once that's over, he is preparing to start an arduous journey towards Mastery as a web application developer through launchschool.com which is an approximately 1-2 year long Mastery-Based Program/bootcamp. It's an exciting time! His previous focus was been on giving basic text some much needed livelihood with (foreground and background) colors and (pre-installed and customized i.e. Google) fonts.
